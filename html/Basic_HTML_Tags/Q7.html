    <h1>Biography of Ada Lovelace</h1>
    <p>
      Ada Lovelace, born Augusta Ada Byron on December 10, 1815, was an English
      mathematician and writer. She is chiefly known for her work on Charles
      Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical
      Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first
      algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine, making her one of the
      first computer programmers.
